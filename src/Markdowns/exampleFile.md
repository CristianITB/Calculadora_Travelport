    2. Short paragraphs. One to two short sentences. One idea per paragraph.
    3. Few paragraphs. No lengthy introductions or conclusions needed.
    4. In some cases, it means incomplete sentences, short lists or visuals instead of words.

3. Tools that help online audiences:

    2. Most important information first.
    3. Information presented concisely. Limit complex sentences, unnecessary adjectives and adverbs.

    9. No semicolons or excessive punctuation.

4. Write with search engine optimization (SEO) in mind in order to be found on the internet.
